Porting of FreeRTOS to a multicore system!

- The platform used is LPC4337.
- It has 2 cores, M0(Slave) and M4(Master).
- FreeRTOS will be running individually on both the cores.
- for M4 RTOS tick will be sysTick timer while for M0 Timer0 will be used
  as RTOS tick.
- Both the processors can communicate to each other with a 
  interprocessor communication protocol.
- The M4 processor is Harvard architecture based while M0 co-processor is 
  von Neumann architecture baesd.
- M4 NVIC has 53 interrupts while M0 NVIC has 32 interrupts.


-- Interprocessor Communication protocol:

- LPC4337 implements shared SRAM as the mailbox for communication between
  them.
- Interrupts based ACK system, with support of NVIC.


--NVIC in LPC4337

- Both M0 and M4 has seprate tightly caupled NVICs for minimal
  interrupt latencies.
- NVIC of M4--can control the system exceptions and peripheral interrupts.
            --53 vectored interrupts.
            --8 programmable interrupt priorities.
            --relocatable vector table.
            --NMI.
            --Soft interrupt generation.

- NVIC of M0--32 vectored interrupts.
            --4 programmable interrupts priorities.

- SysTick is implemented in M4 core which can be used to generate
  SYSTICK exception at a 10ms intervel.

--A 32 bit timer/counter with 32 bit prescaler:
                        -with 4 compare registers.
                        -each firing an interrupt when match occurs.
                        -2 32 bit capture channals for taking snapshot of the counter value, can also genrate interrupt.
                        - Continuous-on match-interrupt.
                        - Stop-on match-interrupt.
                        - Reset-on match-interrupt.
                        - set 0 on match.
                        - set 1 on match.
                        - toggle on match.
                        - do nothing on match.
                        - 2 match registers can be used to genrate timed DMA
                          requests.
                          
                        - RI timer, for repeted interrupts genration(32-bit)
                        - A windowed watchdog timer.

   and memories -Active mode.
