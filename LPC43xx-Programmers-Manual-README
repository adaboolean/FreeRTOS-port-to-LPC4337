Imlementation details of LPC43xx system!

-- Dual cores, M0(Application processor/Host CPU) and M4(co-processor, for off-loading M4, or perform serial IO tasks)
   (both 32-bit).
-- Communication b/w them is performed using a shared SRAM mailbox and interrupts.
-- 204MHz clock support.


-- Interprocessor communication protocol:
    
    
    M4(MASTER)---->----INTR------>------>M0(SLAVE)
    ^                                    |
    |------------<-----INTR------<-------|
    
    |    ptr        Host       ptr       |
    -------->-------CMD----------<-------
                    BUFFER
    
    |    ptr        Host                 |
    -------->-------MSG----------<-------
                    BUFFER
                    
                    
-- can genrate interrupts from M0 to M4 and vice-versa using SendEvent
   instruction (SEV), to raise the signal TXEV.
-- TXEV is captured by CREG, and should be cleared by interrupt handler of that
   core.

   
-- IPC protocol description:
    -sync and async mode of communication.
    -M4 initialize the M0.
    -M4 can communicate M0 via command queues.
    -message queues are located in M4's address space.
    -M4 can be blocked to access the M0's subsystems.
    
-- IPC Queues:
    -Queues are defined by: -queue start address.
                            -queue stop address.
                            -write ptr.
                            -read ptr.
    -Queue size is set to 3 words.
    -Queue is cyclic in implementation.
    
    -There are two queues: -CMD queue.
                           -MSG queue.
    
    -M4 writes to the CMD queue, write ptr is updated and interrupt is fired to
     M0.
    -M0 read the CMD queue and update the read ptr.
    -M0 reply M4 by writing to the MSG queue and updating the write ptr,
     and an interrupt is fired to M4.
    -This cycle goes on until write ptr. == read ptr, this means either the queue
     is empty or full.
    -To avoid this ambiguity, this condition should never reach in our code.
    
    **For every write ptr updation, in any of the 2 queues, interrupt is fired to
      the corresponding core!
      
-- IPC Protocol:
    -M4 issues 32-bit command to the M0.
    -CMD starts with 16-bit task id, this indicates which task msg refers to.
